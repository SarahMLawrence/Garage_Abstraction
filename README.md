### This task was implemented using the 4 OOPs:
###   1. Inheritance
###      - one object acquiring all non-primitive properties of another object
###      - parent (superclass) / child (subclass) relationship
###   2. Abstraction
###      - hide implementation details
###      - only share essential functionality
###   3. Encapsulation
###      - data(varibles) should be bundled together with the code that operates on that data(methods), rather than allowing direct access
###   4. Polymorphism
###      - takes on many forms
###      - commonly used when a parent class reference is used to refer to a child class object
